js is dynamically typed langueage, no need to explicitly say the data type
typescript = js+ datatype
ts = var x:number

function x():String{} => typescript
The specifations like var,let etc are specified in ECMA script
angular is by default built up in ts

React is popular due to virtual dom.

displaying the data to the user UI is called data binding

react dom is virtual dom => lighter => faster => less comparisons => copied only few elements from dom
diffing algo-> finding the diff in data in binding

conditional rendering
props

tags must be closed

component is a function which must return jsx, component starts with a capital letter
js file with same name as components => recommended

props is the way to pass info or data to component
<Employee tech="java" />

function Employee({tech}){
    return <h1>I am working on {tech}</h1>
}

function Employee(props){
    return <h1>I am working on {props.tech}</h1>
}

props is the data passed to a component

In react we handle conditional rendering in js way\

props is data passed from parent to child, read only
props is an object

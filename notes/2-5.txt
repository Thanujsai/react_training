to update we need state

state is an object which needs to be updated
once the state is updated, the component is re-rendered

this object

prev
functions -- stateless
classes -- stateful --power to update the UI

now
stateful state is being offered into functions using one word HOOKS

hooks are functions, they provide stateful features

function need state
    useState is a Hook
    hooks are functoins that start from the word use *****

function X(){
    return (
        <>
        </>
    )
}

X is a component

component is a functoin which returns jsx
hooks must be used inside the functional component

function X(){
    function updateUsers(){
        var x = useState(); // this is wrong since updateusers is a functoin therefore hooks cannot be used here, they can be used only in components
    }
}

    hooks are functoins that start from the word use *****
    hooks must be used at component level ****

useState -- is a hook which provides powers to powerless, provides state to stateless components

syntax => var[property,handlerFunction(setProperty)] = useState(initial value)
var [ashu,setAshu] = useState("abc")//
var[salary,setSalary] = useState(initialSalary)

setSalary(upatedSalary)
setAshu("def)

default props
function Card({location})

filter,sort on table

when edit button is hit , a form must come up and display all the data of that particular record already to edit => controlled input and two way data binding
